    },
    "control": {
      "q": "Do I stay in control of my accounts?",

    },
    "location": {
      "q": "Do I need to live in Amsterdam?",
      "a": "No — remote creators are welcome. While our studio is based in Amsterdam's historic centre, we work with creators from around the world. Studio shoots can be arranged when you visit, or we can coordinate content creation remotely."
    },
    "services": {
      "q": "What do you do for creators?",

    "safety": {
      "q": "How safe is this?",

    },
    "contentReq": {
      "q": "How much content is required weekly?",
      "a": "Typically 10–20 photos and 2–4 clips per week. Your dashboard shows everything clearly, and we work together to create a schedule that fits your life. Consistency matters, but so does quality — we'll never sacrifice one for the other."
    },
    "different": {
      "q": "What makes BB different?",
      "a": "We don't outsource or use templates — we build creators into characters the world wants to follow. Every brand is handcrafted, every strategy is personalized, and every creator receives the kind of attention typically reserved for celebrities and high-end talent."
